</p>

Enjoy our curated collection of examples and solutions on how to interact with the Root Network (TRN). Use these patterns to build your own robust and scalable decentralized applications.

- [EVM](/examples/evm) – Provide examples on how to deploy Solidity smart contracts on TRN or interact with native pallets via the precompiles
- [Substrate](/examples/substrate) – Provide examples on how to interact with TRN native pallets using [extrinsics](https://docs.substrate.io/learn/transaction-types/)
- [UI](/examples/ui) – Examples on how use popular UI solutions, e.g MetaMask with TRN
