## How to create an account on The Root Network?

Similar to Ethereum, The Root Network supports ECDSA format address. The easiest way to generate a test account is to use the MetaMask wallet, follow [this guide to do so](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015289452-How-to-create-an-additional-account-in-your-wallet).

Once the account is generated, go to [TRN Faucet](https://faucet.rootnet.cloud) to fund the account with some test tokens, and effectively create the account on The Root Network.
